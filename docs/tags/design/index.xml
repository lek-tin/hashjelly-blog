      <description>Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.
You may assume the following rules:
 A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block. Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed. A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.  Example: Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; and player 2 is &amp;quot;O&amp;quot; in the board.</description>
