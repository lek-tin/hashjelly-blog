A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Now suppose you are **given the locations and height of all the buildings** as shown on a cityscape photo (Figure A), write a program to **output the skyline** formed by these buildings collectively (Figure B).

![Skyline Problem](https://leetcode.com/static/images/problemset/skyline1.jpg)

Buildings  Skyline Contour
The geometric information of each building is represented by a triplet of integers `[Li, Ri, Hi]`, where `Li` and `Ri` are the x coordinates of the left and right edge of the ith building, respectively, and Hi is its height. It is guaranteed that `0 ≤ Li, Ri ≤ INT_MAX, 0 < Hi ≤ INT_MAX, and Ri - Li > 0`. You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.

For instance, the dimensions of all buildings in Figure A are recorded as: `[ [2 9 10], [3 7 15], [5 12 12], [15 20 10], [19 24 8] ]`.

The output is a list of "key points" (red dots in Figure B) in the format of `[ [x1,y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... ]` that uniquely defines a skyline. A key point is the left endpoint of a horizontal line segment. Note that the last key point, where the rightmost building ends, is merely used to mark the termination of the skyline, and always has zero height. Also, the ground in between any two adjacent buildings should be considered part of the skyline contour.

For instance, the skyline in Figure B should be represented as: `[ [2 10], [3 15], [7 12], [12 0], [15 10], [20 8], [24, 0] ]`.

Notes:
1. The number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range `[0, 10000]`.
2. The input list is already sorted in ascending order by the left `x` position `Li`.
3. The output list must be sorted by the `x` position.
4. There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...[2 3], [4 5], [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...[2 3], [4 5], [12 7], ...]`

###Solution:
```java
class Solution {
    /**
     * Represents either start or end of building
     */
    static class BuildingPoint implements Comparable<BuildingPoint> {
        int x;
        boolean isStart;
        int height;

        @Override
        public int compareTo(BuildingPoint o) {
            //first compare by x.
            //If they are same then use this logic
            //if two starts are compared then higher height building should be picked first
            //if two ends are compared then lower height building should be picked first
            //if one start and end is compared then start should appear before end
            if (this.x != o.x) {
                return this.x - o.x;
            } else {
                return (this.isStart ? -this.height : this.height) - (o.isStart ? -o.height : o.height);
            }
        }
    }

    public List<int[]> getSkyline(int[][] buildings) {
        //for all start and end of building put them into List of BuildingPoint
        BuildingPoint[] buildingPoints = new BuildingPoint[buildings.length*2];
        int index = 0;
        for(int building[] : buildings) {
            buildingPoints[index] = new BuildingPoint();
            buildingPoints[index].x = building[0];
            buildingPoints[index].isStart = true;
            buildingPoints[index].height = building[2];

            buildingPoints[index + 1] = new BuildingPoint();
            buildingPoints[index + 1].x = building[1];
            buildingPoints[index + 1].isStart = false;
            buildingPoints[index + 1].height = building[2];
            index += 2;
        }
        Arrays.sort(buildingPoints);
        // for (BuildingPoint b: buildingPoints) {
        //     System.out.println(b.x);
        //     System.out.println(b.isStart);
        //     System.out.println(b.height);
        //     System.out.println("----------");
        // }

        //using TreeMap because it gives log time performance.
        //PriorityQueue in java does not support remove(object) operation in log time.
        TreeMap<Integer, Integer> queue = new TreeMap<>();
        //PriorityQueue<Integer> queue1 = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        queue.put(0, 1);
        //queue1.add(0);
        int prevMaxHeight = 0;
        List<int[]> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for(BuildingPoint buildingPoint : buildingPoints) {
            //if it is start of building then add the height to map. If height already exists then increment
            //the value
            if (buildingPoint.isStart) {
                queue.compute(buildingPoint.height, (key, value) -> {
                    if (value != null) {
                        return value + 1;
                    }
                    return 1;
                });
              //  queue1.add(cp.height);
            } else { //if it is end of building then decrement or remove the height from map.
                queue.compute(buildingPoint.height, (key, value) -> {
                    if (value == 1) {
                        return null;
                    }
                    return value - 1;
                });
                // queue1.remove(cp.height);
            }
            //peek the current height after addition or removal of building x.
            int currentMaxHeight = queue.lastKey();
            //int currentMaxHeight = queue1.peek();
            //if height changes from previous height then this building x becomes critcal x.
            // So add it to the result.
            if (prevMaxHeight != currentMaxHeight) {
                result.add(new int[]{buildingPoint.x, currentMaxHeight});
                prevMaxHeight = currentMaxHeight;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
