Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

**Note:**
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given:
```
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
```
Return the following binary tree:
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
