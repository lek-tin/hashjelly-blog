Some fundamental concepts/components in the CUDA architecture:
1. thread:  
2. core/kernel:  
3. warp: a set of threads (commonly 32) that get executed simultaneously.
4. streaming multiprocessor: 
5. texture: 
6. control divergency:  
7. CPU DMA:  
8. Grid: a collection of parallel thread blocks.
9. __syncthreads:
10. Shared memory:
11. warp occupancy:
