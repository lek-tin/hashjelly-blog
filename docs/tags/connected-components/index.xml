      <description>You are given an undirected connected graph. An articulation point (or cut vertex) is defined as a vertex which, when removed along with associated edges, makes the graph disconnected (or more precisely, increases the number of connected components in the graph). The task is to find all articulation points in the given graph.
Input:
The input to the function/method consists of three arguments:
 numNodes, an integer representing the number of nodes in the graph.</description>

      <description>Given an underected connected graph with n nodes labeled 1..n. A bridge (cut edge) is defined as an edge which, when removed, makes the graph disconnected (or more precisely, increases the number of connected components in the graph). Equivalently, an edge is a bridge if and only if it is not contained in any cycle. The task is to find all bridges in the given graph. Output an empty list if there are no bridges.</description>
