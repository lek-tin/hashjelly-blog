Given an array of `n` integers nums and a target, find the number of index triplets `i`, `j`, `k` with `0 <= i < j < k < n` that satisfy the condition `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target`.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [-2,0,1,3], and target = 2
Output: 2 
Explanation: Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:
             [-2,0,1]
             [-2,0,3]
```
### Solution
```python
```
