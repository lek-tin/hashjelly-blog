Given a 2D board containing `'X'` and `'O'` (the letter `O`), capture all regions surrounded by `'X'`.  

A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.  

### Example

```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```
After running your function, the board should be:
```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```

#### Explanation

Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any `'O'` on the border of the board are not flipped to `'X'`. Any `'O'` that is not on the border and it is not connected to an `'O'` on the border will be flipped to `'X'`. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

### Solution

Find all those `'O'`s on the border and `dfs` from them. Mark all the `'O'`s connected to these **border** `'O'`s as 'W'. Then mark the remaining `'O'`s as `'X'`s. Finally, reverse all the `'W'`s to `'O'`s

    public void solve(char[][] board) {
        if (board == null || board.length == 0 || board[0].length == 0) return;

        int N = board.length, M = board[0].length;
        markInvalidZeroes(board, N, M);
        flipValidZeroes(board, N, M);
        reverseInvalidZeroes(board, N, M);
    }

    private void markInvalidZeroes(char[][] board, int N, int M) {
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (board[i][0] == 'O') {
                dfs(board, i, 0);
            }
            if (board[i][M-1] == 'O') {
