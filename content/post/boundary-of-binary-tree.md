Given a binary tree, return the values of its boundary in **anti-clockwise** direction starting from root. Boundary includes **left boundary**, leaves, and right boundary in order without duplicate nodes.

**Left boundary** is defined as the path from root to the **left-most** node. Right boundary is defined as the path from root to the **right-most** node. If the root doesn't have left subtree or right subtree, then the root itself is **left boundary** or right boundary. Note this definition only applies to the input binary tree, and not applies to any subtrees.

The **left-most** node is defined as a leaf node you could reach when you always firstly travel to the left subtree if exists. If not, travel to the right subtree. Repeat until you reach a leaf node.

The **right-most** node is also defined by the same way with left and right exchanged.

### Example 1
```
Input:
  1
   \
    2
   / \
  3   4

Ouput:
[1, 3, 4, 2]
Explanation:
The root doesn't have left subtree, so the root itself is left boundary.
The leaves are node 3 and 4.
The right boundary are node 1,2,4. Note the anti-clockwise direction means you should output reversed right boundary.
So order them in anti-clockwise without duplicates and we have [1,3,4,2].
```
### Example 2
```
Input:
    ____1_____
   /          \
  2            3
 / \          / 
4   5        6   
   / \      / \
  7   8    9  10  
       
Ouput:
[1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3]
Explanation:
The left boundary are node 1,2,4. (4 is the left-most node according to definition)
The leaves are node 4,7,8,9,10.
The right boundary are node 1,3,6,10. (10 is the right-most node).
So order them in anti-clockwise without duplicate nodes we have [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3].
```

### Solution:
```java

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public List < Integer > boundaryOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        List < Integer > left_boundary = new LinkedList < > (), right_boundary = new LinkedList < > (), leaves = new LinkedList < > ();
        preorder(root, left_boundary, right_boundary, leaves, 0);
        left_boundary.addAll(leaves);
        left_boundary.addAll(right_boundary);
        return left_boundary;
    }

    public boolean isLeaf(TreeNode cur) {
        return (cur.left == null && cur.right == null);
    }

    public boolean isRightBoundary(int flag) {
        return (flag == 2);
    }

    public boolean isLeftBoundary(int flag) {
        return (flag == 1);
    }

    public boolean isRoot(int flag) {
        return (flag == 0);
    }

    public int leftChildFlag(TreeNode cur, int flag) {
        if (isLeftBoundary(flag) || isRoot(flag))
            return 1;
        else if (isRightBoundary(flag) && cur.right == null)
            return 2;
        else return 3;
    }

    public int rightChildFlag(TreeNode cur, int flag) {
        if (isRightBoundary(flag) || isRoot(flag))
            return 2;
        else if (isLeftBoundary(flag) && cur.left == null)
            return 1;
        else return 3;
    }

    // 0: root
    // 1: left boundary node
    // 2: right boundary node
    // 3: middle node
    public void preorder(TreeNode cur, List < Integer > left_boundary, List < Integer > right_boundary, List < Integer > leaves, int flag) {
        if (cur == null)
            return;
        if (isRightBoundary(flag))
            right_boundary.add(0, cur.val);
        else if (isLeftBoundary(flag) || isRoot(flag))
            left_boundary.add(cur.val);
        else if (isLeaf(cur))
            leaves.add(cur.val);
        preorder(cur.left, left_boundary, right_boundary, leaves, leftChildFlag(cur, flag));
        preorder(cur.right, left_boundary, right_boundary, leaves, rightChildFlag(cur, flag));
    }
}
