The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

1.  1
2.  11
3.  21
4.  1211
5.  111221
1 is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
11 is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
21 is read off as `"one 2`, then one `1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`, generate the `n`<sup>th</sup> term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```
