Given a 2D board containing `'X'` and `'O'` (the letter `O`), capture all regions surrounded by `'X'`.  

A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.  

### Example

```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```
After running your function, the board should be:
```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```

#### Explanation

Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any `'O'` on the border of the board are not flipped to `'X'`. Any `'O'` that is not on the border and it is not connected to an `'O'` on the border will be flipped to `'X'`. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

### Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        if not any(board):
            return

        n, m = len(board), len(board[0])
        q = [ij for k in range(max(n,m)) for ij in ((0, k), (n-1, k), (k, 0), (k, m-1))]
        while q:
            i, j = q.pop()
            if 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m and board[i][j] == 'O':
                board[i][j] = 'W'
                q += (i, j-1), (i, j+1), (i-1, j), (i+1, j)

        board[:] = [['XO'[c == 'W'] for c in row] for row in board]
```
