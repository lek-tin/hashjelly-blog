Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

The above elevation map is represented by array `[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!

**Example:**
```
Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
