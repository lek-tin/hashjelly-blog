      <description>Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
 Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right. Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.  Example: Consider the following matrix: [ [1, 4, 7, 11, 15], [2, 5, 8, 12, 19], [3, 6, 9, 16, 22], [10, 13, 14, 17, 24], [18, 21, 23, 26, 30] ] Given target = 5, return true.</description>

      <description>Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
Given binary search tree: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]</description>
