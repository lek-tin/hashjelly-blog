Given a string `S`, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of `S` that occur `2` or more times.  (The occurrences may overlap.)  

Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length.  (If `S` does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is `""`.)  

### Example 1:

```
Input: "banana"
Output: "ana"
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: "abcd"
Output: ""
```

#### Note:

2 <= S.length <= 10^5
S consists of lowercase English letters.

### Solution

Java
```java
```
