Given an array `nums` of n integers and an integer `target`, are there elements a, b, c, and d in `nums` such that `a + b + c + d = target`? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of `target`.

**Note:**

The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

Example:
```
Given array nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.

A solution set is:
[
  [-1,  0, 0, 1],
  [-2, -1, 1, 2],
  [-2,  0, 0, 2]
]
```
